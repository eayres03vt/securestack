# to at all (WAF can't attach directly to a plain EC2 instance).
# This stays deployed permanently - it's the WAF Web ACL below
# that gets toggled on/off around demos to control cost.

# WAF Web ACL - inspects every request hitting the load balancer
# before it reaches the app, using AWS's pre-built managed rule
# sets rather than writing detection rules from scratch.
#
# COST NOTE: this resource has no AWS free tier - roughly
# $5/month base + ~$1/month per rule group + a small per-request
# fee, for as long as it exists. The plan is to apply this before
# a demo/interview and destroy it afterward:
#   terraform apply   -target=aws_wafv2_web_acl.main -target=aws_wafv2_web_acl_association.main
#   terraform destroy -target=aws_wafv2_web_acl_association.main -target=aws_wafv2_web_acl.main
# The load balancer above stays up either way, so the app's URL
# never changes - only the WAF protection toggles.
